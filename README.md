# Python-Tutorial

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has now become the language of choice in
many fields of science. This is largely due to its ease of programming and readability, the large number
of libraries and community support, and the variety of programming environments (e.g. command line
interpreters, scripts, web-based interpreters, notebooks). This tutorial, which is largely based on Corey
Schafer’s excellent [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms/featured), is a crash course in Python designed to give you an overview of
the programming essentials, as well as some useful tools for scientific computing, data processing, and
visualization.

The majority of the modules in this tutorial are written in Jupyter Notebooks (formally IPython
Notebooks). This is a web-based interactive development environment (IDE) for writing code (e.g.,
Python, Markdown, LATEX, etc.) and displaying graphics. It uses a notebook format similar to Wolfram
Mathematica or Windows OneNote, where interactive cells of code can be executed one at a time by a
kernel (a centralized “computational engine”). While the kernel is running, all the data generated by
your code is stored temporarily in your computer’s random access memory; allowing you to access data
generated in previous cells.

Jupyter Notebooks can be run in a web browser if you have Python and Jupyter installed locally.
However, it is highly recommended to install and use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to work through this
tutorial. This IDE integrates the three most common Python environments (command line, scripts, and
notebooks), allowing you to choose the most convenient option. It also has built-in features for debugging
and streamlines the installation of third-party extensions for additional features like code linting.
